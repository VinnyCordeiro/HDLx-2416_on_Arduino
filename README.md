Arduino library for HDLx-2416 dot matrix display family from Avago Technologies
===============================================================================
Created by Vinicius N. Cordeiro, February 20, 2011. Released into the public domain.

The code is extremely non-optimized, feel free to improve it. The included example code is a left-pointed arrow running to the left of the display in 500ms time intervals, nothing fancy at all.

The actual code uses all 14 digital I/O pins of the Arduino, you may want to use a port expander to free some of them.

Initial release. After having coded that 5 years ago I have found the files on my computer. Sorry YouTube user tekvak for the delay, but OP (finally) delivered!
