Arduino library for HDLx-2416 dot matrix display family from Avago Technologies
===============================================================================
Created by Vinicius N. Cordeiro, February 20, 2011. Released into the public domain.

The code is extremely non-optimized, feel free to improve it. The included example code shows all characters scrolling on the screen in 500ms time intervals, nothing fancy at all.

The actual code uses all 14 digital I/O pins of the Arduino, you may want to use a port expander to free some of them.
